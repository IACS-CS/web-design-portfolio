# Simple Web Design Project

Welcome to our simple web design project! This project is designed to help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an easy-to-understand environment.

Instructions for this project will be updated and live here:
[https://iacs-cs.github.io/web-design-instructions/portfolio-project/]

- Instructions for understanding GitHub CodeSpaces are below.

## Running the Project

There are two ways to run the project and see your changes in real-time:

### Using the Play Button

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Click on the "Run and Debug" button on the sidebar (it looks like a play button).
3. Select "Open with Live Server" from the drop-down menu.
4. Click the green play button. This will start a local server and open your project in a web browser.

### Using the Terminal

1. Open the terminal in VS Code.
2. Type `npm start` and press Enter. This will start a local server and open your project in a web browser.

## Editing Your Project

- **index.html**: This is your HTML file. Edit it to change the structure of your web page.
- **style.css**: This is your CSS file. Modify it to change the styling of your web page.
- **main.js**: This is your JavaScript file. Use it to add interactivity to your web page.

## Adding Extensions

You should be prompted to install extensions when this Codespace loads -- say yes and you'll
get automatic code formatting set up as well as github copilot (an AI tool to try to help you code).

## Files You Can Ignore

You don't need to worry about the following files and folders. They are used to set up and run your project environment:

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Configuration files for Node.js.
- `node_modules`: A folder containing all the packages and dependencies for the project.
- `.vscode`: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for help.
